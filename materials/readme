The files here are gzipped tar files of examples and exercise solutions
for the book Beginning Perl for Bioinformatics by James Tisdall, published
by O'Reilly & Associates in 2001.

MODULE

BeginPerlBioinfo.pm	module containing subroutines from the text

You'll need the module BegPerlBioinfo.pm for most of the examples and exercises.
Place it in the same directory (or folder) as the programs you're trying to
run; if you'd prefer, other places to install the module can be found in the book
or in the Perl documentation.

EXAMPLES

The file begperlbio_examples.tar.gz contains all the numbered examples
from the book in ASCII format.

EXERCISES

The exercises are in a few different files:
Chapters 4 to 8:	begperlbio_exercises_part1.tar.gz
Chapter 9:		begperlbio_exercises_ch09.tar.gz
Chapter 10:		begperlbio_exercises_ch10.tar.gz
Chapter 11:		begperlbio_exercises_ch11.tar.gz
Chapter 12:		begperlbio_exercises_ch12.tar.gz



I expect to post revised forms of these solutions, as readers find bugs or
improvements in the code.  But I should remind you that since this is a book
for beginners, the code may promote clarity and simplicity to the detriment
of completeness, or robustness in the presence of unexpected input; this is
by design.

SEND ME YOUR SOLUTIONS

I also invite you to send in your favorite solutions to selected exercises.
After I've collected enough of them, I'll post some of them -- with due credit given --
in this place, for the dual purpose of encouraging your work, and for showing
how alternate solutions to a programming problem can all be "correct".

Thanks for your interest, and good luck with the material!

Sincerely,
Jim
